The dataset of this project is share by __Dr. Joseph Pau Cohen__ from University of Montreal in an attempt to predict and understand the infection. His repository where I downloaded the dataset can be found [here](https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset).

Below are some key points regarding this project:
